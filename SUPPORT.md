If you're here, you probably need help with something. That's amazing! You've had a problem and instead of giving up
you're looking for solutions.

The fastest way to get help is through our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rdce5GXRrC). Alternatively, you could reach us
on Twitter [@rubatopy](https://twitter.com/rubatopy) or through email at [info@rubato.app](mailto:info@rubato.app).

You are always welcome to open an issue and if you find the solution to you're issue, feel free to suggest a
documentation change!
